# Charity Kindness Wall

## Overview
The **Charity Kindness Wall** is an online platform designed to facilitate charitable contributions and aid individuals in cities, villages, and provinces. The system allows individuals to donate items they no longer need to those in need. It serves as a virtual wall of kindness where people can offer their surplus belongings to others who may find them useful.

To implement this system in each city, village, or province, a network of charitable institutions acts as intermediaries between donors and recipients. Donors can deliver their items to local institutions, which, in turn, register the donated items in the system. When a person in need requests a particular item, the institution can fulfill the request after necessary verification and coordination.

## Objectives
- **Facilitate Charitable Contributions:** Enable individuals to contribute to charity by donating items they no longer require.
- **Local Charitable Institutions:** Establish partnerships with local charitable institutions to act as intermediaries, managing the transfer of items from donors to recipients.
- **Online Visibility:** Display donated items on the website, allowing those in need to browse and request specific items.
- **Geographical Accessibility:** Provide an interactive map displaying the locations of charitable institutions in different cities and provinces.

## System Features
1. **Donation Process:**
   - Donors deliver items to local charitable institutions.
   - Charitable institutions register donated items in the system.
   - Items become visible on the website for those in need to browse.

2. **Request Process:**
   - Individuals in need browse the website for available items.
   - Requests are submitted for desired items.
   - Charitable institutions verify requests and coordinate item distribution.

3. **Geographical Mapping:**
   - The "Contact Us" section displays a map and addresses of charitable institutions in various provinces and cities.

4. **Monetary Donations:**
   - Donors can contribute monetary donations to charitable institutions for broader assistance to individuals in need (e.g., homeless children, patients).
