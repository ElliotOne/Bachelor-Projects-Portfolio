# Console Application: N-Queens Problem Solver

## Overview

Welcome to the N-Queens Problem Solver console application! This program automatically solves the N-Queens problem for different board sizes (N*N) and saves the results to a `data.txt` file.

## Features

- **Automatic Solution:**
  - The application automatically solves the classic N-Queens problem, placing N queens on an N*N chessboard in a way that no two queens threaten each other.

- **Result Storage:**
  - The results of the N-Queens problem for each board size are saved in the `data.txt` file.

## Main Functionality

- **Run Algorithm:**
  - The program runs the N-Queens algorithm for board sizes ranging from 4 to 16.

- **View and Save Results:**
  - The results, including the solutions and execution times, are displayed on the console and saved to the `data.txt` file.

- **How to Use:**
  - Run the application.
  - View the automatically generated solutions and execution times.
  - The results are saved to `data.txt`.
  - Exit the application when you are done.
