# Console Application: Merge-Sort-Analyzer

## Overview

Welcome to the Merge Sort Analyzer console application! This program analyzes the performance of the Merge Sort algorithm in two versions: the normal version and the smart version.

## Merge Sort Versions

### Normal Merge Sort
- This version uses the classic implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.
- It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

### Smart Merge Sort
- This version includes an optimization for arrays of size 2.
- If the array size is 2, it directly compares and swaps the elements if necessary.

## Main Functionality

- **Generate and Analyze:**
  - The application generates arrays of different sizes (from 2 to 1000 with a step of 1).
  - It applies both normal and smart Merge Sort algorithms to analyze their performance.
  - The results, including array size and execution time, are saved in the `data.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. Run the application.
2. The program will automatically generate arrays and apply both normal and smart Merge Sort algorithms.
3. View the results in the `data.txt` file.
4. Exit the application when you are done.
