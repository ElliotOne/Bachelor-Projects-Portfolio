# Console Application: Fibonacci and Quick Sort Algorithms

## Overview

Welcome to the Fibonacci and Quick Sort Algorithms console application! This program demonstrates two algorithms: Fibonacci (with normal and smart versions) and Quick Sort (with best-case and worst-case scenarios). The results of the algorithms are saved to a `data.txt` file.

## Features

- **Fibonacci Algorithm:**
  - Choose between the normal and smart versions of the Fibonacci algorithm.
  - Generate execution times for Fibonacci calculations up to a limit.

- **Quick Sort Algorithm:**
  - Compare Quick Sort execution times for both sorted and random arrays.
  - Vary the array size from 100 to 10,000 to observe best-case and worst-case scenarios.

## Main Functionality

- **Run Algorithms:**
  - Execute the smart and normal versions of the Fibonacci algorithm.
  - Compare Quick Sort execution times with sorted and random arrays.

- **Data Storage:**
  - The results, including execution times, are stored in the `data.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. Run the application.
2. Observe execution times for smart and normal Fibonacci algorithms.
3. Compare Quick Sort execution times for best-case (random) and worst-case (sorted) scenarios.

4. View the results in the `data.txt` file.
5. Exit the application when you are done.
