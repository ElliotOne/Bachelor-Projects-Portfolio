# Console Application: Page Replacement Algorithms

## Overview

Welcome to the Page Replacement Algorithms console application! This program implements three page replacement algorithms - Optimized, LRU (Least Recently Used), and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) - in the context of an operating system.

## Features

- **Optimized Algorithm:**
  - Utilizes an optimized approach to manage page replacements efficiently.
  - Demonstrates error counts during the execution.

- **LRU Algorithm:**
  - Implements the Least Recently Used algorithm for page replacement.
  - Tracks errors and updates the RAM accordingly.
 
- **FIFO Algorithm:**
  - Implements the First-In-First-Out algorithm for page replacement.
  - Keeps track of errors and updates the RAM based on the FIFO principle.

## Main Functionality

- **Run Algorithms:**
  - Execute the Optimized, LRU, and FIFO page replacement algorithms.
  - Observe the updates in RAM and error counts during the process.

- **How to Use:**
  - Run the application.
  - Enter the template count when prompted.
  - Enter the input string, separating values with commas.
  - Observe the execution of the Optimized, LRU, and FIFO algorithms.
  - Review error counts and RAM updates for each algorithm.
  - Exit the application when done.
